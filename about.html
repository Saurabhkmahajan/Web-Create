    <div class="container">
       <p1>
        It is a long established fact that a will be distracted by the readable content
         of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <br><br>
         Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
         normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
         readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
          model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
          <br><br>Various version
         evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body. It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the .accordion-body  though the transition does limit overflow.
